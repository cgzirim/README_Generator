# README Generator
I wrote this README.md generator to make writing READMEs for ALX school projects easier - keeping me from procrastinating. 

## Prerequisite
- Python3 must be installed on your machine.

## Features
- Sorts tasks in ascending order automatically.

## Installation
Fork or clone this repo to your any directory on your machine. For Linux, I recommend the root directory.

## Usage
Once you have the `README_Generator` directory on your computer:
1. `cd` to the directory
2. Open the `rdm` file, Not `rdm.py`, and fill in the relative path to the directory.
3. Copy the `rdm` file to your working directory.

From your working directory:
- Run `./rdm` to see all commands you can use to making the README.md file.
- Run `./rdm create` to create a new README.md file
- Run `./rdm task` to add a new task to the README.md file.

Note: When you open the README.md file, after using this program to create it, you'll find lots of comments - Do Not modify those. The program relies on those comments to create the README.md file. When you push the README.md file to GitHub it would appear without those comments.
